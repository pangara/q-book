    "A qubit as we know is a single unit of quantum computation, and is represented by a vector with  $ |0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. As the number of qubits increases, we have to take into account a combined system of qubits. Qubits combine via tensor products. \n",

    "In this section, we discuss what the symbols $|q_0\\rangle$, or $|0\\rangle$ mean. These are called qubits. A qubit or a quantum bit is a unit of quantum information. Unlike a classical bit which can be 0 or 1, quantum mechanics allows qubits to be in a superposition of both states 0 and 1. We will learn more about superposition soon, but it can be thought of as a combination of 0 and 1. \n",

    "The state we look at before $ |\\psi>~= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2}|0>+~\\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2}|1>  $ is also a superposition state. Moreover, since the value of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the same, we can say that the state is in an equal superposition of $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. In classical computing, we are always manipulating zeros and ones to get what we want. You must wonder how we get from one state to another quantumly because, at the end of the day, we want to perform a computation quantumly! This is where gates come in and are the topic of discussion in the next section.\n",

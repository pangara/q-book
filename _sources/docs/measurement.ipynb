    "# Measurement\n",

    "We now move from the quantum realm, to the classical realm. A measurement is essentially an operation on a qubit to get some classical information. This is because one cannot look at quantum information, it is hidden. Whatever state the qubits are in, they resolve to 0 or 1 on measurement. To understand more about measurement, one needs to know the postulates of quantum mechanics. These provide a mathematical framework for describing everything from quantum states to our universe. Postulates are beyond the scope of this introductory tutorial, however, a great resource is [Quantum Country](https://quantum.country/qm).\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we will think of measurement as a probability and stick to the computational basis. \n",

    "* The box has 50 balls colored pink and grey.\n",

    "* How many of these are pink, and how many are grey? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Can you make a guess?  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can look a ball out one at a time and see what color it is. If we pick pink the first time, it doesn't give us an idea about the rest of the balls. However, if we keep picking up more and more balls, we start to get an idea - it could be 25% pink, 75% grey, or 50% pink and 50% grey or 100% pink. \n",

    "Quantum states are very similar. The possiblity of measuring a qubit to be in the state $|0\\rangle$ or $|1 \\rangle$ is based on the values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ called the probability amplitudes. \n",
    "Given a state $ |\\psi\\rangle~= \\alpha~|0\\rangle+~\\beta~|1\\rangle $, the probability of finding the qubit in state  $|0\\rangle$ is $|\\alpha|^2$ and the probability of finding the qubit in state  $|1\\rangle$ is $|\\beta|^2$.\n",

# Qubits to Quantum Teleportation

Hi there!

This is a small example tutorial on quantum teleportation that has been built using Jupyter Books. 

```{note}
This repository is based on Scientific Python Quickstart: a short sequence of lectures on Python programming for scientific
work, written by [Thomas J.  Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/) and [John
Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/).This uses the new Sphinx-based [Jupyter Book
2.0](https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html) tool set, as part of the
[ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/).  
Instructions for how to build them from source can be found in the Jupyter
Book documentation.
```

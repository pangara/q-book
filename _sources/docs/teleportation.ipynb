    "# Quantum Teleportation\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to understand how the teleportation circuit works. From our section on motivation, we understand that teleportation is a process of sending quantum information. Sounds simple enough, but we have a problem called the **no-cloning theorem**. The no-cloning theorem is a result of quantum mechanics which forbids the creation of identical copies of an arbitrary unknown quantum state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "* Alice has to send a qubit to Bob. \n",
    "* Alice and Bob have a pre-shared Bell State\n",
    "* Alice can send only classical information to Bob\n",
    "* Alice doesn’t know the state of the qubit, even if she does, describing it would take an infinite amount of classical information since qubits take value in a continuous space. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "* Alice interacts $|\\psi\\rangle$ with her half of the Bell pair, and then makes a measurement (Bell basis measurement)\n",
    "* She obtains one of four classical results 00, 01, 10 or 11 and sends this information to Bob\n",
    "* Depending on Alice’s classical message, Bob performs one of four operations on his half of the EPR pair\n",
    "* This recovers the state $|\\psi\\rangle$!\n",

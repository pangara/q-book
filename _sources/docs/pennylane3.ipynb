    "We are finally ready to create and run the teleportation circuit using PennyLane. We have to do the following after setup:\n",
    "1. Create a device with three wires\n",
    "2. Prepare the first qubit in some desired state\n",
    "2. Eve: Prepare a bell pair between the second and third qubit.\n",
    "2. Alice: Perform CNOT between the first and second qubit, followed by a Hadamard\n",

    "Measurement has to be the last part in a quantum circuit in PennyLane, i.e., we cannot perform partial measurements. Fortunately, the [Principle of Deferred Measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Measurement_Principle) comes to our rescue. This is a result of quantum computing which states that delaying measurements until the end of a quantum computation does not affect the probability distribution of the outcomes. Therefore, we can swap the last two steps without affecting our results. \n",

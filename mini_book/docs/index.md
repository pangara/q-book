# From Qubits to Quantum Teleportation

Dear Xanadu Team,

This is my submission for the technical task component of the Xanadu Residency Program 2021 for the Education track. This is a small tutorial that:
1. focuses on the basics of quantum computing that are necessary to understand quantum teleportation and 
2. explains the quantum teleportation algorithm.

This tutorial has been built in the form of an interactive textbook and has been built using [Jupyter Books](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). This tutorial is suitable for someone who is between high school and first year university and is curious to get started with quantum computing.



```{note}
This repository is based on Scientific Python Quickstart: a short sequence of lectures on Python programming for scientific work, written by [Thomas J.  Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/) and [John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/).This uses the new Sphinx-based [Jupyter Book 2.0](https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html) tool set, as part of the [ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/).  
Instructions for how to build them from source can be found in the Jupyter Book documentation.
